# Copy-of-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
Sonar Object Classification
This project aims to classify objects as either rocks or mines using sonar data. It utilizes logistic regression to train a model on the provided dataset and makes predictions based on user input.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn


You can install them using pip:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

Getting Started

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ravella-1504/Copy-of-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction.git

Change into the project directory:
cd Sonar-Object-Classification

Prepare the data:

Download the sonar dataset in CSV format.
Place the CSV file in the project directory.

Run the code:
python sonar_classification.py

The code will train a logistic regression model on the dataset and display the accuracy on the training and test data.

Enter the sonar data values for prediction when prompted.

The system will predict whether the object is a rock or a mine based on the input data.

Understanding the Code:

The code uses pandas to load the sonar dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
It performs basic exploratory data analysis by displaying the first few rows, shape, and statistical measures of the dataset.
The data is divided into features (X) and labels (Y).
The dataset is split into training and test sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
A logistic regression model is trained on the training data using the fit method.
The accuracy of the model is calculated on both the training and test data using the accuracy_score function.
The user can input new sonar data values, and the model will make predictions based on the input.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project should be a CSV file containing sonar data. The file should have the object's features as columns and a label column indicating whether it is a rock ('R') or a mine ('M'). Make sure the CSV file is formatted correctly and contains relevant data.

Limitations and Future Improvements
The current implementation uses logistic regression, which is a linear classifier. It may not capture complex patterns in the data.
Experimenting with other classification algorithms and model architectures could potentially improve the classification performance.
The dataset used for training and testing plays a significant role. Expanding the dataset with more samples and diverse instances can improve the model's generalization capability.
The code can be further optimized for performance and efficiency.
